# lichess-ratings-to-openings-analysis

When looking for a new opening to play, the first thing I did was to search for the opening which is statisically the best. Unfortunately, the only
[results](https://thechessworld.com/articles/openings/chess-statistics-top-10-best-openings-for-white-and-black/) I could 
find were based on GMs. Unfortunately, [I](https://lichess.org/@/jhadden04) am not a GM, so this advice didn't really apply to me, so I had to go back to the drawing board.

The solution was to use the [lichess database](https://database.lichess.org/) and parse 5000,000games and their openings and find the win percentage
of each opening for each rating band.
